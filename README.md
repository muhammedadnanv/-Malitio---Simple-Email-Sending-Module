Detailed Explanation
Setting Up Nodemailer
Malitio uses Nodemailer to handle the email sending process. Nodemailer is a well-known module for Node.js applications to send emails. It supports various email services, including Gmail, Yahoo, and more.

Creating the Transporter
The sendEmail function creates a transporter object using the nodemailer.createTransport method. This transporter is configured with the email service and authentication details (email and password of the sender).

Sending the Email
The sendEmail function then creates the email options, including the sender's email, recipient's email, subject, and message body. It uses the transporter.sendMail method to send the email. If the email is sent successfully, a success message is logged; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

Error Handling
The sendEmail function includes basic error handling to catch and log any errors that occur during the email sending process. This ensures that you are informed if there are any issues with sending the email.
